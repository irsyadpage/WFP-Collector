WFP-Collector: Automated Dataset Collection Framework for Website Fingerprinting Evaluations on Tor Browser


## Description
When researching WFP on Tor, a sufficiently large and clean dataset is crucial for a quality and accurate experiment. WFP-Collector is an open-source framework that automatically enables researchers to build a suitable dataset for WFP experiments. This framework automates the tedious and repetitive tasks of webpage visits, network traffic capturing, data filtering, and data validation, freeing up the researcher’s time for other, more productive tasks. WFP-Collector also supports a flexible and configurable dataset creation process that can conform to various researchers’ requirements and conditions.
